/**
 * Fix consecutive rematches in the schedule
 * 
 * A consecutive rematch is when the same two teams play each other in consecutive weeks
 * (e.g., Team A @ Team B in Week 5, Team B @ Team A in Week 6)
 * 
 * This function finds all consecutive rematches and swaps one of the games to a different week.
 * It respects pre-scheduled weeks and will never modify games in those weeks.
 * 
 * @param schedule - The schedule to fix
 * @param teams - List of all teams
 * @param preScheduledWeeks - Set of weeks that are pre-scheduled and should not be modified
 * @returns Fixed schedule with no consecutive rematches
