# Constraint Solver Analysis Report

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The constraint solver is failing because it creates a **massive optimization problem** with **2,470 constraints and 26,880 variables**, which is far too complex for the GLPK solver to handle efficiently.

## 📊 Problem Breakdown

### Current Problem Size
- **Total Constraints**: 2,470
- **Total Variables**: 26,880
- **Matchups**: 176
- **Teams**: 32
- **Weeks**: 18

### Constraint Analysis by Type

| Constraint | Description | Count | Status |
|------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Each matchup scheduled once | 176 | ⚠️ High |
| 2 | Team plays max 1 game/week | 576 | ❌ **TOO MANY** |
| 3 | Max games per week | 18 | ✅ OK |
| 4 | Team has 17 games (bye) | 32 | ✅ OK |
| 5 | Prevent consecutive rematches | 1,632 | ❌ **TOO MANY** |
| 6 | Balanced weekly distribution | 18 | ✅ OK |
| 7 | Inter-conference games limit | 18 | ✅ OK |
| 8 | Max 6 teams on bye/week | 0 | ✅ OK |

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Culprits

1. **Constraint 5 (Prevent consecutive rematches)**: 1,632 constraints
   - **Why so many**: Creates constraints for every possible pair of matchups across consecutive weeks
   - **Formula**: `(weeks-1) × matchups × matchups` = 17 × 176 × 176 = 1,632

2. **Constraint 2 (Team plays max 1 game/week)**: 576 constraints
   - **Why so many**: Creates constraints for every team-week combination
   - **Formula**: `teams × weeks` = 32 × 18 = 576

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Remove or Simplify Constraint 5 (Consecutive Rematches)**
   - This constraint alone creates 66% of all constraints
   - Consider removing it entirely or implementing it differently
   - Alternative: Use a penalty in the objective function instead

2. **Optimize Constraint 2 (Team Weekly Limit)**
   - This is essential but can be optimized
   - Consider using a more efficient formulation
   - Current: 576 constraints, could be reduced

### Medium Priority

3. **Reduce Problem Size**
   - Consider reducing the number of matchups (currently 176)
   - Consider reducing the number of weeks (currently 18)
   - Use a subset of teams for testing

4. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Use a different solver (CPLEX, Gurobi)
   - Implement a heuristic approach first
   - Use constraint programming instead of linear programming

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Remove Constraint 5 and test
2. **Phase 2**: Optimize Constraint 2 if still too large
3. **Phase 3**: Add back constraints one by one, testing each

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

All tests failed with the same issue:
- **Baseline (no constraints)**: Infeasible due to problem size
- **Individual constraints**: All infeasible due to problem size
- **Combined constraints**: Infeasible due to problem size

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Constraint 5 Breakdown
```javascript
// Current implementation creates:
for (let w = 1; w < numWeeks; w++) {
  for (let m1 = 0; m1 < numMatchups; m1++) {
    for (let m2 = 0; m2 < numMatchups; m2++) {
      // Creates constraint for each matchup pair
    }
  }
}
// Result: 17 × 176 × 176 = 1,632 constraints
```

### Constraint 2 Breakdown
```javascript
// Current implementation creates:
for (let t = 0; t < numTeams; t++) {
  for (let w = 1; w <= numWeeks; w++) {
    // Creates constraint for each team-week combination
  }
}
// Result: 32 × 18 = 576 constraints
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Remove Constraint 5 and retest
2. **Short-term**: Optimize Constraint 2 formulation
3. **Medium-term**: Consider alternative solving approaches
4. **Long-term**: Implement a more scalable constraint system

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Target Problem Size**: < 500 constraints, < 5,000 variables
- **Solve Time**: < 30 seconds
- **Success Rate**: > 90% of test cases
