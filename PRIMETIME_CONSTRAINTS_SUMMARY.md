## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Interfaces**
```typescript
interface ScheduledGame {
  // ... existing fields ...
  primetimeSlot?: 'MNF' | 'TNF' | 'SNF' | 'INTERNATIONAL' | null;
  timeSlot?: 'EARLY' | 'LATE' | 'PRIMETIME';
  networkPreference?: 'CBS' | 'FOX' | 'NBC' | 'ESPN' | 'AMAZON' | 'NFL_NETWORK';
}

interface ScheduleConstraints {
  // ... existing constraints ...
  primetimeConstraints?: {
    mondayNightFootball?: { /* detailed config */ };
    thursdayNightFootball?: { /* detailed config */ };
    sundayNightFootball?: { /* detailed config */ };
    flexScheduling?: { /* flex windows */ };
  };
}
```

### **Constraint Solver Integration**
- **Binary variables** for each primetime slot: `mnf_m_w`, `tnf_m_w`, `snf_m_w`
- **Linking constraints** ensure primetime games are also regular games
- **Team appearance limits** for fair distribution across all teams
- **Weekly requirements** guarantee exactly 1 primetime game per slot per week
- **Enhanced solution extraction** identifies and labels primetime games

### **Realistic Default Settings**
```typescript
primetimeConstraints: {
  mondayNightFootball: {
    enabled: true,
    gamesPerWeek: 1,
    maxAppearances: 3,
    preferredTeams: ['cowboys', 'patriots', 'packers', 'steelers', 'chiefs'],
    avoidWeeks: [18]
  },
  thursdayNightFootball: {
    enabled: true,
    gamesPerWeek: 1,
    maxAppearances: 2,
    minimumRestDays: 4,
    avoidBackToBack: true,
    startWeek: 2
