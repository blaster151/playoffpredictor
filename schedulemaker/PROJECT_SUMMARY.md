# NFL Schedule Builder - Project Summary

## What We Built

A React-based NFL schedule builder that prevents users from painting themselves into scheduling dead-ends through **multi-stage real-time feasibility checking** and **constraint-aware narration**.

## Core Innovation: Constraint-Aware Narration

Instead of just saying "constraint violated," the app acts as an intelligent assistant:

### Before
> ❌ "Insufficient capacity"

### After  
> 🟡 **Bye Pressure**: "Only 2 bye slots left for 3 teams. Cowboys, Bears, and Jets must be assigned by Week 12."

> 🔴 **Rematch Windows**: "Bears-Packers rematch window closing — must schedule between Weeks 10-12 (min 4-week gap)."

> 🟡 **Cross-Conference**: "8 NFC-AFC games needed, starting soon — only 6 weeks left (need 1.3 per week)."

## Architecture

### Dual-Mode UI (Same Underlying Data)

Both modes are just different **lenses** on the same canonical schedule:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   [ Week View | Team View ]         │ ← Toggle seamlessly
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│   ┌─────────────────────────────┐   │
│   │   Shared Schedule State     │   │
│   │   (Zustand Store)           │   │
│   │                             │   │
│   │   • Games                   │   │
│   │   • Teams                   │   │
│   │   • Weeks                   │   │
│   │   • Constraints             │   │
│   │   • Undo Stack              │   │
│   └─────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Week-by-Week ("Season Flow")**
- Timeline view: schedule all games for Week 1, then Week 2...
- See the season emerge naturally
- Great for understanding flow and television scheduling

**Team-by-Team ("Franchise Planner")**
- Focus on one team's 17-game slate
- Strategic: build home/away balance, manage divisional matchups
- Reciprocal scheduling: placing Bears @ Lions automatically locks Lions vs Bears

### Multi-Stage Feasibility Pipeline

Runs on **every action** (< 10ms total):

```
User drops a game
     ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage A: Bounds Check (< 1ms)     │ ← Cheap necessary conditions
│ • Total capacity                   │
│ • Category quotas                  │
│ • Bye feasibility                  │
│ • Home/away parity                 │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓ (only if A passes)
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage B: Matching (< 5ms)          │ ← Bipartite graph checks
│ • Legal pairings for next 2 weeks │
│ • Over-constraint detection        │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓ (only if B passes)
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage D: Reserves (< 5ms)          │ ← Rolling forecast
│ • Division game windows            │
│ • Team availability forecast       │
│ • Rematch spacing windows          │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓
Convert to narrative messages
     ↓
Display as constraint chips
```

**Future Stages** (not yet implemented):
- **Stage C**: Flow model (global capacity routing)
- **Stage E**: SAT solver (definitive proof + UNSAT cores)

### Visual Language

**🟢 Green** = Healthy  
**🟡 Yellow** = Tight (last window)  
**🔴 Red** = Impossible (dead-end detected)

#### Example Constraint Bar
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 All constraints healthy                               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

or when things get tight:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟡 Bye Pressure  🟡 Prime-Time Slots  🟡 Rematch Windows │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     ↓ click to expand
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Bye Pressure                           │
│ 5 teams still need byes                │
│ Only 6 slots available in weeks 10-14  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Example Narratives

### Bye Week Crunch
```
Teams needing byes: 8
Remaining slots:   6  (Weeks 10-14)

Narrative:
🔴 "8 teams need byes but only 6 slots left"
   → Click: Shows which teams, suggests moving earlier games to free slots
```

### Rematch Spacing
```
CIN played CLE in Week 4
Minimum gap: 4 weeks
Earliest rematch: Week 8
Current week: 14

Narrative:
🟡 "CIN-CLE rematch window closing (earliest: Week 8, latest: Week 18)"
   → Only 4 valid weeks remain
```

### Prime-Time Quota
```
Remaining SNF/MNF/TNF slots: 5
Teams needing night game:    7

Narrative:
🔴 "Only 5 night games left for 7 teams: DAL, CHI, NYJ, PHI, SF, KC, BUF"
   → System detects pigeonhole violation early
```

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Schedulers
- Let you build incrementally
- Only validate when done
- Error: "Invalid schedule" (no context)
- User has to manually backtrack

### This Scheduler
- Validates on every action
- Catches dead-ends early ("Week 14 trap")
- Explains why: "Bears have 3 division games left but only 2 legal weeks"
- Suggests fixes: "Move CIN-BAL to Week 6 to free spacing"

## Future Enhancements

### Stage C: Flow Model
```typescript
// Global capacity routing
Source → Teams (demand) → Weeks (capacity) → Sink
```
Detects: "Even with perfect pairing, not enough home-game slots"

### Stage E: SAT Solver
```typescript
// Definitive proof + conflict explanation
MiniSat/Z3 in Web Worker
Returns: UNSAT core (minimal conflicting constraints)
```
UI: "These 3 games are incompatible: [highlights them]"

### Drag-and-Drop
- Visual game placement
- Real-time legality preview (green/red zones)
- Snap-to-slot with constraint tooltips

### Suggestions Panel
```
Legal moves this week:
  → CIN @ SEA (inter-conference quota)
  → DAL @ NYG (division, Sunday Night eligible)
  → KC bye (must happen by Week 14)
```

### Schedule Export
- CSV (for spreadsheets)
- JSON (for APIs)
- iCal (for calendars)
- PNG (visual timeline)

### Historical Templates
- Load real 2023/2024 NFL schedules
- Use as learning examples
- "Remix" mode: change a few games, see ripple effects

## NFL Scheduling Rules Enforced

### Per-Team Constraints
- 17 games (1 more than weeks → bye week)
- 6 division games (3 opponents × 2)
- 4 intra-conference games
- 4 inter-conference games
- 3 "rotation" games
- ~8-9 home/away split
- Max 2 consecutive home/away
- 1 bye (weeks 5-14 only)
- Min 4-week rematch spacing

### Per-Week Constraints
- 16 games per week (32 teams ÷ 2)
- Max 6 teams on bye per week
- Limited prime-time slots:
  - 1 Thursday Night
  - 1 Sunday Night
  - 1 Monday Night
  - (~2 Saturday late-season)

### Global Constraints
- Every team: 1-5 prime-time appearances
- Balanced television distribution
- Travel considerations (future)

## Usage

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Develop
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:5173

# Build
npm run build

# Preview production
npm run preview
```

## Development Notes

### State Management
- Zustand store with Immer for immutability
- History stack for undo/redo
- Derived state computed on-demand (no caching needed yet)

### Performance
- Stage A: synchronous, < 1ms
- Stage B: synchronous, < 5ms
- Stage D: synchronous, < 5ms
- Total: < 10ms per action (imperceptible)

### Future Optimizations
- Memoize expensive narration computations
- Run Stage C in Web Worker
- Debounce Stage E SAT checks (300ms after last action)

## Why This Matters

**Scheduling is NP-hard.** Even experienced NFL schedulers use constraint solvers. But pure automation removes the human strategy and creativity.

This tool gives users:
1. **Control**: Manual placement, drag-and-drop feel
2. **Safety**: Real-time dead-end detection
3. **Learning**: Understand why NFL schedules are complex
4. **Fun**: Puzzle-like satisfaction when you complete 18 weeks

It's like **Sudoku with look-ahead hints** — you're solving it, but the system prevents you from getting stuck.

## Credits

Built as a demonstration of:
- Constraint satisfaction without full CSP solving
- Multi-stage feasibility checking (cheap → expensive)
- Conversational constraint feedback
- Dual-mode UX on shared state

Inspired by real NFL scheduling complexity and the need for human-in-the-loop tools that prevent frustration while preserving agency.
